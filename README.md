 - This bot is designed to be a full-featured server assistant, offering powerful moderation tools, scheduled reminders, support ticketing, and interactive role verification. It will also include quality-of-life features like sticky messages, suggestions, and anonymous confessionsâ€”making server management smoother and community engagement easier.


# Planned Features

- ## Stage 1: Moderation & Reminders
    - Add core moderation commands:
        - `ban`, `kick`, and `warn`

    - Set up logging system:
        -  Log all moderation actions to a designated **ban-log channel** & (optional) **ban announcement channel** 
    
    - Add bump reminder system:
        - Automatically remind users to run `/bump` at set intervals

- ## Stage 2: Tickets & Verification
    - Create a ticket system:
        - Users can open support tickets via command or button

    - Implement auto role assignment:
        - Running `/verify` sends an embed
        - Embed includes interactive buttons to select roles

- ## Stage 3: Quality of Life Features
    - Add sticky messages **(auto-reposting messages to keep them visible)**
    - Suggestion system **(with upvote/downvote reactions or threads)**
    - Anonymous confession feature

- ## Stage ???: Later Down the Road
    - Have a bot setup when first invited
    - Allow channel ids to be set with commands on bot invite or manually 
    - ping command to have a subcommand/alternate command of `/rawr`, and the response (even to `/ping`) will be "Lion roared back in `<insert ping time here>`"
